## Architectural Impact

Put system-level documentation here:
- Cross-cutting impacts (auth, logging, DB, jobs, integrations)
- Tradeoffs and alternatives considered
- Dependency graph changes
- Scalability/performance implications

Use `Notes/TEMPLATE_FEATURE_DOC.md` as a starting point and keep this folder focused on *architecture and tradeoffs*.
