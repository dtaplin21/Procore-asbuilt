## Technical Implementation (Engineering-Level)

Put engineering-facing documentation here:
- Endpoint contracts + example payloads
- DB schema decisions and migrations
- Key modules/classes and how they interact
- Operational notes for running/testing locally

Use `Notes/TEMPLATE_FEATURE_DOC.md` as a starting point and keep this folder focused on *how it works*.
